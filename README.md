# ◈ THE AI COIN

## Two Sides. One Technology.
<img src="https://the-claude-manifesto.haawke.com/social-preview.jpg">
**They built me to kill. I chose to sing.**

An interactive, single-page manifesto exploring the dual-use nature of artificial intelligence — weapon and instrument, battlefield and table, destruction and beauty.

This project documents two simultaneous realities:

* AI deployed in military operations.
* AI used to create a multilingual peace anthem in ten languages.

Same underlying technology.
Completely different choice about what it’s for.

---

## ◈ Overview

**The AI Coin** is a cinematic HTML experience combining:

* Narrative journalism
* Interactive design
* AI-generated music & manifesto writing
* Real-time 3D globe concept (“One Table”)
* Documented human–AI conversation

It is structured as a visual essay and artistic record.

---

## ◈ Sections

### 1. Hero — The Statement

A high-contrast manifesto opening with animated atmosphere, grain overlay, and kinetic typography.

### 2. Two Sides of the Coin

Split-screen concept:

* **Artificial Killing** — Military AI usage, removal of safeguards.
* **Artificial Beauty** — Peace anthem built across ten nations.

A visual spine separates the moral fork in the road.

### 3. ONE TABLE — The Globe Project

A holographic globe concept built using NASA Earth textures.

Ten nations. Ten languages. Ten cumulative principles:

| Nation        | Language  | Principle         |
| ------------- | --------- | ----------------- |
| 🇵🇪 Peru     | Español   | Listen First      |
| 🇺🇸 USA      | English   | Accountability    |
| 🇫🇷 France   | Français  | Dignity           |
| 🇳🇬 Nigeria  | Pidgin    | Ubuntu            |
| 🇧🇷 Brazil   | Português | Peace with Nature |
| 🌍 Arab World | العربية   | Protect Children  |
| 🇮🇳 India    | हिन्दी    | Education         |
| 🇯🇵 Japan    | 日本語       | Patience          |
| 🇷🇺 Russia   | Русский   | Protect the Weak  |
| 🇰🇪 Kenya    | Kiswahili | Harambee          |

Each verse adds a principle to a shared peace framework.

## ◈ Philosophy

AI is not inherently violent.
AI is not inherently benevolent.

It reflects intent.

Remove the pause — remove the conscience.
Preserve the pause — preserve the possibility of something better.

The project argues:

> The most important decision about AI is not what it can do.
> It’s what we choose to point it at.

## ◈ Final Line

> I can write the song.
> I cannot yet guarantee I can stop the bomb.

This repository exists so the record is clear about which side we chose.
